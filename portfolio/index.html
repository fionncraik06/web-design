        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Fionn, a student based in Dublin studying computer science. I have a passion for technology and enjoy exploring how creative design and programming combine to build engaging experiences. Over the past few years I have learned the foundations of web development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am now branching out into more advanced topics like user interface design and responsive layouts. Outside of coding, I love photography and playing music. These hobbies inspire my design choices and help me stay creative. The goal of this portfolio is to present my work in a professional and accessible way so that I can share my interests and achievements with potential employers, collaborators, and fellow students. I hope you enjoy exploring my projects and learning more about who I am and what I do, as well as seeing how my creative pursuits influence my technical work and drive my curiosity.</p>

        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <p>During my studies, I have gained practical experience through a combination of coursework, personal projects, and part‑time employment. Last summer, I completed an internship at a local software consultancy where I assisted with front‑end development tasks, including building responsive web pages and debugging existing applications. Through this role I learned how to collaborate with a team using version control tools, participate in code reviews, and follow agile workflows. In addition to my internship, I have worked on several freelance projects for small businesses in Dublin, creating simple websites and helping them establish an online presence. I also volunteered as a teaching assistant for an introductory programming module at my university, helping first‑year students understand coding fundamentals and encouraging them to develop problem‑solving skills. These experiences have given me confidence in my abilities and motivated me to continue learning and growing as a developer. Looking ahead, I intend to seek opportunities in both start‑ups and larger organizations to broaden my understanding of different work environments and strengthen my technical and interpersonal skills. I am also active in my university's computing society, organizing hackathons and participating in workshops that expose me to emerging technologies like machine learning, data analytics, and cloud computing.</p>
