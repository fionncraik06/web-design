        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Fionn, a student based in Dublin studying Computing for Business. I have a passion for technology and enjoy exploring how creative design and programming combine to build engaging experiences. Over the past few years I have learned the foundations of web development in both school while studying computer science and college, especially web design where there is a more heavy focus on HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and I am now branching out into more advanced topics like user interface design and responsive layouts. Outside of coding, I love Rugby and Star Wars. These hobbies inspire my design choices and help me stay creative. The goal of this portfolio is to present my work in a professional and accessible way so that I can share my interests and achievements with potential employers, collaborators, and fellow students. I hope you enjoy exploring my projects and learning more about who I am and what I do, as well as seeing how my creative pursuits influence my technical work and drive my curiosity.</p>

        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <p>During my studies, I have gained practical experience through a combination of coursework, personal projects, and partâ€‘time employment. Last summer I interned at a local software consultancy. There I developed various front-end tasks, including writing responsive web pages to debugging existing web applications. This role taught me about how to work with other people using as a team, how to do analyse code, and how to work under time constraints. I also did freelance work on a few projects for small companies in Dublin through the creation of small websites. These experiences built my confidence in my abilities and moved me toward continued learning and growth as a developer. For my career, I hope to work within many different start-ups and large companies to gain a good balance of experience, and learn about different work environments, technical skills and soft skills.</p>
